#Note to self

#For public ssh key, use 'type' in command prompt, not cat (since you're using Windows system, not Mac)
#After opening repo folder, change directory using cd FOLDERNAME.
#Also use file saved -> git add. -> git commit -> git push in order for Windows (don't use origin master, your terminal doesn't read it)
#Use git status to check and reload your github repo page to confirm the changes
